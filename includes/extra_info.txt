This is just a note on learning about hashing and salting a password.
Hashing a password is pretty easy to understand. There are programs that will
accomplish this for me. ie MD5, SH1, SH2, Blowfish. The problem comes from a
hacker having a 'rainbow' table which has a huge list of random words and
possible passwords which they try through the hashing program to match the
passwords they stole. This is where salting a password comes in. Salting adds
something to the password like a string or even better something unique like
the username or time or a pseudo-random string which is the best. To know salt
is to know the random string....

Salt will have to be stored in the database. Also good idea to hash the salt.

Version of this:
$salt = md5(uniqid(mt_rand(), true));

the mt_rand(): will generate a random string.
uniqid: gives it an unique id, with true to make it extra secure
md5: hashes the whole thing so that it is encrypted and not in plain text as
    as to when it gets stored in the database.
